# FlightGear Simulator Web App
A web application that is used to display the position of the aircraft in real time.

### Installing 
* Download and install the simulator on your computer- https://www.flightgear.org/download/
* Add the  generic_small.xml file to the /data/Protocol directory where you installed the simulator
* Config the following settings in the 'Settings' tab in the simulator:
```
--telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,5402,tcp
--generic=socket,out,10,127.0.0.1,5400,tcp,generic_small
```

This will open two communication sockets - 'in' where you send commands to the simulator, and 'out' where you receive data from it.
